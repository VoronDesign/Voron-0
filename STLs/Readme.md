# Part File Naming Guide


**QUANTITY REQUIRED**

*[a]_Thumb_Nut_x3.stl*  
Any file that ends with “_x#” is telling you the quantity of that part required to build the machine.

**BUILD SPECIFIC PARTS**

*SKR_E3_V3_Din_Mount.stl*  
Any file name that does **NOT** end with a quantity designation is a part that needs to be choosen based on the specific components and options you want for your build, things like controller boards, ADXL mounts or the Bowden toolhead are exampls of parts that will not have quantities and can be printed or not based on your choosing. 

**ACCENT COLOR**

*[a]_Tensioner_Knob_x2.stl*  
We have added “[a]” to the front of any STL file that is intended to be printed with accent color. The parts are marked with a heart in the manual when they first appear. 

**PRIMARY COLOR**

*B_Drive_Frame_Lower_x1.stl*  
These files will have nothing at the start of the filename.

**CLEAR / TRANSLUCENT**

*[c]_Display_Diffuser_x1.stl*  
Any file that begins with "[c]" is intended to be printed in a clear or translucent color that allows light to penetrate through it.
