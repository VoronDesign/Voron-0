B_Drive_Frame_Lower_x1.stl
These files will have nothing at the start of the filename.

**ACCENT COLOR**

[c]_Display_Diffuser_x1.stl
Any file that begins with "[c]" is intended to be printed in a clear or translucent color that allows light to penetrate through it.

[a]_Thumb_Nut_x3.stl
Any file that ends with “_x#” is telling you the quantity of that part required to build the machine.
