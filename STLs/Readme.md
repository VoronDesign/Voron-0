# What Parts to Print

- you need to print every part in the root STL folder 
- If you are using a display you will need all parts in the Display folder
- in the Skirts folder, all parts and then either the Foot_Rear_Right_FRS_x1.STL or the Foot_Rear_Right_Plain_x1.STL depending on whether or not you are using the FRS (Filament Runout Sensor) or not
- 

**PRIMARY COLOR**

B_Drive_Frame_Lower_x1.stl
These files will have nothing at the start of the filename.

**ACCENT COLOR**

[a]_Tensioner_Knob_x2.stl
We have added “[a]” to the front of any STL file that is intended to be printed with accent color. The parts are marked with a heart in the manual when they first appear. 

**CLEAR / TRANSLUCENT**

[c]_Display_Diffuser_x1.stl
Any file that begins with "[c]" is intended to be printed in a clear or translucent color that allows light to penetrate through it.

**QUANTITY REQUIRED**

[a]_Thumb_Nut_x3.stl
Any file that ends with “_x#” is telling you the quantity of that part required to build the machine.
