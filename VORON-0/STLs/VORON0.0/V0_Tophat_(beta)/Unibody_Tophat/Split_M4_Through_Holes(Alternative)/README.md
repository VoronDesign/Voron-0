### Differences from main Unibody tophat

- `Tophat`, `Clip` and `Corner Mount` holes have been changed to 4mm in diameter and now go through. These can be attached together with M4 nuts and bolts.
- There is a version split into 2 parts which allows printing on mid-size print beds (e.g.: Prusa MK3s, Ender). Print either `1part_Tophat_x1` or print `2parts_Tophat_PartA_x1` and `2parts_Tophat_PartB_x1`
