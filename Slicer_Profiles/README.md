# V0 Slicer Files:

## PrusaSlicer

The slicer profiles are exported from the built in V0 SuperSlicer configuration and manually edited to be compatible with PrusaSlicer.

- Note: 

     If using Firefox you can right click the "VoronV0.ini" link and choose "Save link as.." to easily download the config file without downloading the entire repo.
        
     If you are using Chrome or a Chromium based browser then using the method above will likely result in import errors as Chrome adds HTML information to the beginning of the profile text. You're better off copying the contents of the file and pasting them into a text file name "VoronV0.ini".
